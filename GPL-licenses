 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble  序言

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
该 GNU 通用公共许可证是一种自由、Copyleft 的软件和其他类型作品的许可证。

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
大多数软件和其他实用作品的许可证旨在剥夺您共享和修改作品的自由。相比之下,GNU 通用公共许可证旨在保证您分享和更改程序所有版本的自由——以确保它永远是所有用户的自由软件。我们,自由软件基金会,将 GNU 通用公共许可证用于我们大部分的软件;它也适用于作者以这种方式发布的任何其他作品。您也可以将其应用于您的程序。

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
当我们谈及自由软件时,我们指的是自由,而非价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您有自由分发自由软件拷贝(如果您愿意,也可以收费),您可以获得源代码或按需获取,您可以修改软件或在新的自由程序中使用其中的部分,并且您知道您可以做这些事情。

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
为保护您的权利,我们需要阻止他人否认您这些权利或要求您放弃这些权利。因此,如果您分发软件副本或对其进行修改,您就有某些责任:尊重他人自由的责任。

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
例如,如果您分发此类程序的副本,无论是免费还是收费,您必须向收件人传递您收到的相同自由。您必须确保他们也收到或能够获得源代码。您还必须向他们展示这些条款,以便他们知道自己的权利。

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
开发者使用 GNU GPL 通过两个步骤来保护您的权利:(1)对软件声明版权,以及(2)向您提供本许可证,授予您合法复制、分发和/或修改的权限。

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
为了开发人员和作者的保护，GPL 清楚地解释说这个自由软件没有任何担保。为了用户和作者的利益,GPL 要求修改版本要标记为已更改,这样其问题就不会被错误归咎于之前版本的作者。

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
一些设备被设计用于拒绝用户安装或运行其内部软件的修改版本,尽管制造商可以这样做。这与保护用户更改软件的自由这一目标根本不兼容。这种滥用行为在个人使用产品的领域存在系统化的模式,这正是它最不可接受的地方。因此,我们设计了 GPL 的这个版本,以禁止这些产品的这种做法。如果在其他领域出现类似的重大问题,我们将准备在未来的 GPL 版本中扩展此规定,以保护用户的自由。

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
最后,每个程序都不断面临软件专利的威胁。各国不应允许专利限制一般用途计算机上的软件开发和使用,但在那些允许的国家,我们希望避免专利被应用于自由软件而使其实际上为专有软件的特殊危险。为了防止这种情况,GPL 保证了专利不会被用于使程序失去自由性。

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
以下是翻译结果:

复制、分发和修改的具体条款和条件如下。

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS  条款和条件

  0. Definitions.  定义。

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
这个许可证指的是 GNU 通用公共许可证第 3 版。

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
也意味着适用于其他类型作品的类版权法,例如半导体掩膜。

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
本程序"指根据本许可证授权的任何有版权的作品。每个被许可人被称为"你"。"被许可人"和"收件人"可以是个人或组织。

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
修改一项作品意味着以需要获得版权许可的方式复制或改编该作品的全部或部分,而不是制作一个精确的副本。所得到的作品被称为较早作品的"修改版"或基于较早作品的作品。

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
一个"已覆盖的作品"是指未经修改的程序或基于该程序的作品。

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
传播一项作品意味着对其进行任何未经许可的行为,这些行为根据适用的版权法会使你直接或间接承担侵权责任,但在计算机上执行或修改私人副本除外。传播包括复制、分发(无论是否修改)、向公众提供,以及在某些国家的其他活动。

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
传达"作品"意味着任何类型的传播,使其他方能制作或接收副本。通过计算机网络与用户的简单互动,没有转移副本,即不构成传达。

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
一个交互式用户界面会显示"适当的法律声明"，只要它包含一个方便且显眼的功能,该功能 (1) 显示适当的版权声明,以及 (2) 告知用户该作品没有任何担保 (除非提供担保),被许可人可以根据本许可证传播该作品,以及如何查看本许可证的副本。如果界面提供用户命令或选项列表,如菜单,列表中的一个显著项目符合此标准。

  1. Source Code.  源代码。

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
源代码"指用于修改作品的首选形式。"目标代码"指作品的任何非源代码形式。

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
一个"标准接口"是指一种接口,要么是由一个公认的标准机构定义的正式标准,要么是针对特定编程语言指定的,在从事该语言编程的开发人员中广泛使用的接口。

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
可执行作品的"系统库"包括任何不属于整个作品的内容，但满足以下条件：(a)包含在主要组件的标准打包形式中，但不属于该主要组件的一部分；(b)仅用于使作品与该主要组件配合使用，或实现公众可获得源代码形式的标准接口。在此上下文中,"主要组件"指该可执行作品所依赖的特定操作系统的主要 essential 组件(如内核、窗口系统等)，或用于生成该作品的编译器，或用于运行该作品的目标代码解释器。

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
相应的源代码是指以目标代码形式的作品中所需的所有源代码,包括生成、安装和(对于可执行作品)运行目标代码以及修改作品所需的脚本。然而,它不包括该作品的系统库、通用工具或通常可用的免费程序,这些在执行这些活动时使用时未经修改,但不是作品的一部分。例如,相应的源代码包括与作品的源文件相关的接口定义文件,以及作品专门设计要求使用的共享库和动态链接子程序的源代码,例如通过亲密的数据通信或控制流在这些子程序与作品的其他部分之间。

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
相应的源代码不需要包含用户可以从相应源代码的其他部分自动重新生成的任何内容。

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
相应的源代码形式的作品来源就是同样的作品。

  2. Basic Permissions.  2. 基本权限。

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
本许可下授予的所有权利是为程序版权期限授予的,并且只要满足述明的条件,这些权利就是不可撤销的。本许可明确确认您无限运行未修改程序的权限。只有当输出内容构成受本许可覆盖的作品时,从运行受保护作品产生的输出才受本许可的覆盖。本许可承认您的合理使用权或其他等同权利,如版权法所提供的。

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
您可以制作、运行和传播您不传达的受保护作品,只要您的许可证仍然有效。您可以向他人传达受保护的作品,唯一目的是让他们为您进行独家修改,或为您提供运行这些作品的设施,前提是您遵守本许可证传达所有您不控制版权的材料的条款。那些为您制作或运行受保护作品的人必须完全代表您,在您的指导和控制下,并且条款禁止他们在与您的关系之外制作您的受版权保护的任何副本。

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
在任何其他情况下传达都仅在以下所述条件下允许。不允许再许可;第 10 节使其不必要。

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
保护用户免受反规避法的合法权利。

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
没有被覆盖的作品应被视为适用法律履行 1996 年 12 月 20 日通过的 WIPO 版权条约第 11 条或类似法律禁止或限制绕过此类措施的有效技术措施的一部分。

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
当您传达受保护的作品时，您放弃了禁止绕过技术措施的任何法律权力,只要这种绕过是通过行使本许可证下的权利来实现的。您也放弃了限制作品操作或修改的任何意图,作为对作品用户实施您或第三方禁止绕过技术措施的合法权利的手段。

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
传送逐字副本。

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
您可以以任何媒体形式传播您收到的该计划源代码的逐字副本，前提是您在每个副本上明显和恰当地发布适当的版权声明;保持所有声明此许可和根据第 7 节添加的任何非许可性条款适用于该代码的通知完整;保持所有关于缺乏任何保修的通知完整;并向所有收件人提供一份此许可证的副本以及该计划。

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
您可以为您传达的每个副本收取任何价格或不收费用，并且您可以提供支持或质保保护,收取费用。

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
传达修改后的源代码版本。

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
您可以根据第 4 节的条款，以源代码的形式传达基于该程序或从该程序修改而产生的作品,前提是您也满足以下所有条件:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
该作品必须包含明显的声明,说明您对其进行了修改,并给出相关日期。

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
该作品必须包含显著的通知,说明它是根据本许可证发布的,以及根据第 7 节添加的任何条件。这一要求修改了第 4 节中"保持所有通知完整"的要求。

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
您必须为任何获得副本的人全权许可本作品，作为整体，根据本许可证。因此，本许可证将适用于整个作品及其所有部分,连同任何适用的第 7 条附加条款,不论它们如何打包。本许可证并未授予您以任何其他方式许可本作品的权限,但如果您单独获得了此类许可,它也不会使其无效。

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
如果该作品具有交互式用户界面,每个界面都必须显示适当的法律声明;但是,如果该程序具有不显示适当法律声明的交互式界面,您的作品也无需让它们这样做。

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
一个被许可作品与其他独立作品的编译，这些独立作品并不是被许可作品的延伸，也没有与之结合形成更大的程序,存储或发行媒体的一个卷册中,如果编译及其版权未被用于限制编译用户的访问权或法律权利,超出了单独作品的许可,则称其为"总汇"。被许可作品被包括在总汇中,并不会导致本许可证适用于总汇的其他部分。

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
传达非源代码形式。

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
您可以根据第 4 和第 5 节的条款以目标代码形式传达受保护的作品,前提是您还根据本许可证的条款传达机器可读的相应源代码,方式如下:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
在物理产品（包括物理分发介质）中传达对象代码，并附有固定在常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上的相应源代码。

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
将该对象代码以物理产品（包括物理分发媒体）的形式传达,并附有一份书面提议,在至少三年内有效,并在您提供该产品型号的备件或客户支持期间内有效,以向拥有该对象代码的任何人提供以下内容:(1)以通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上提供该产品中受此许可证涵盖的所有软件的对应源代码副本,价格不超过您实际执行此源代码传输的合理成本,或者(2)免费访问网络服务器上的对应源代码。

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
在不定期的非商业情况下,配合提供相应的源代码,传递目标代码的个人副本是允许的。这种替代方案只有在您以这种方式收到目标代码时才适用,这符合第 6b 小节的规定。

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
你应：

1. 通过提供从指定位置访问的方式（免费或收费）传递目标代码，并以相同的方式通过相同的位置免费提供相应的源代码。你无需要求收件人在复制目标代码时同时复制相应的源代码。如果复制目标代码的位置是网络服务器，相应的源代码可以位于由你或第三方运营的其他服务器上，但前提是该服务器能够提供相等的复制功能，并在目标代码附近明确说明相应源代码的位置。不管相应源代码位于哪个服务器，你都有义务确保只要满足这些要求时它就一直可用。

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
使用对等传输传送目标代码，前提是您通知其他同伴，根据第 6d 款，该工作的目标代码和相应源代码可以免费向公众提供。

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
对象代码的可分割部分,其源代码在对应源代码中被排除为系统库,不需要包括在传递对象代码工作中。

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
一个"用户产品"是(1)一个"消费产品",即通常用于个人、家庭或家庭用途的有形动产,或(2)任何设计或销售用于纳入住宅的东西。在确定一个产品是否为消费品时,存疑的情况应当有利于予以覆盖。对于一个特定用户收到的特定产品,所谓"通常使用"是指该类产品的典型或常见用途,而不管特定用户的情况或者特定用户实际使用或预期使用该产品的方式。一个产品是否属于消费产品,不受该产品是否有大量商业、工业或非消费用途的影响,除非这些用途代表了该产品的唯一重要使用方式。

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
用户产品的"安装信息"指安装和执行该用户产品的修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息,这些信息来自其相应源代码的修改版本。该信息必须足以确保修改后的目标代码的持续运行在任何情况下都不会因为进行了修改而被阻止或干扰。

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
如果您在此部分下传达一个目标代码作品，并且传达发生在转让用户产品的永久或固定期限占有和使用权的交易的一部分（无论如何描述该交易），则必须附带安装信息传达本节规定的相应源代码。但是，如果您或任何第三方都无法在用户产品上安装修改后的目标代码（例如，该作品已安装在 ROM 中），则此要求不适用。

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
提供安装信息的要求不包括继续为已被接收方修改或安装的作品或其已被修改或安装的用户产品提供支持服务、担保或更新的要求。当修改本身对网络的运行造成重大不利影响或违反网络通信的规则和协议时,可能会拒绝访问网络。

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
相应的源代码以及安装信息应当根据本节的要求提供,其格式必须是公开记录的(并且有公开可用的源代码实现),且解压、阅读或复制时不需要特殊密码或密钥。

  7. Additional Terms.  7. 附加条款。

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
以下是该文本的简体中文翻译:

"附加权限"是补充本许可证条款的条款,通过对其中一个或多个条件做出例外。适用于整个程序的附加权限应被视为已包含在本许可证中,只要它们在适用法律范围内有效。如果附加权限仅适用于程序的某部分,则该部分可在这些权限下单独使用,但整个程序仍受本许可证管辖,不受附加权限的影响。

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
当您传达受保护作品的副本时，您可以选择从该副本或其任何部分中删除任何额外权限。(在某些情况下修改作品时，可能需要另行写明删除额外权限的要求。)您可以对您添加到受保护作品中的材料授予额外权限,只要您拥有或能够授予适当的版权许可。

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
尽管本许可证的其他条款，对于您添加到受保护作品的材料，您可以（如果该材料的版权持有人授权）补充本许可证的条款:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
免除保修或限制责任,与本许可证第 15 条和第 16 条的条款不同;或

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
要求保留该材料中指定的合理法律通知或作者署名,或包含该材料的作品中显示的适当法律通知

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
禁止虚假陈述该材料的来源,或要求对该材料的修改版本以合理的方式进行标记,以区别于原始版本;或

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
限制使用材料许可人或作者姓名作为宣传目的

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
拒绝根据商标法授予使用某些商号、商标或服务标记的权利；或

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
要求任何传达该材料(或其修改版本)并以合同方式承担责任的人对该材料的许可方和作者提供赔偿,以应对这些合同假设直接施加于这些许可方和作者的任何责任。

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
所有其他非许可性的附加条款都被视为第 10 条中所述的"进一步的限制"。如果您收到的程序或其任何部分包含一条声明,指出它受此许可证的约束,以及一条进一步的限制条款,则您可以删除该条款。如果许可证文件包含进一步的限制,但允许在本许可证下再许可或传播,您可以将受该许可证文件条款约束的材料添加到受保护的作品中,前提是该进一步的限制不会在此再许可或传播中存续。

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
如果您根据本部分添加条款到涵盖作品中,您必须在相关源文件中放置适用于这些文件的附加条款声明,或指示在何处可以找到适用条款的通知。

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
附加条款,无论是允许性的还是非允许性的,可以以单独书面许可的形式声明,或以例外的形式声明;无论采取哪种方式,上述要求都适用。

  8. Termination.  8. 终止。

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
您不得传播或修改受保护作品,除非本许可证明确允许。以其他方式传播或修改作品的任何尝试都是无效的,并且会自动终止您在本许可证下的权利(包括第 11 条第三款授予的任何专利许可)。

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
但是，如果你停止对本许可证的所有侵犯行为，那么你从特定版权持有人那里获得的许可证就会(a)暂时恢复有效,除非和直到版权持有人明确和最终终止你的许可证,以及(b)永久恢复有效,如果版权持有人未能在停止侵犯行为后 60 天内以合理方式通知你侵犯行为。

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
此外,如果版权持有人以某种合理的方式通知您违反了版权,这是您第一次从该版权持有人收到违反本许可证(任何作品)的通知,并且您在收到通知后 30 天内纠正了违反行为,则您从该特定版权持有人处获得的许可将永久恢复。

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
您在本节项下的权利终止并不终止您根据本许可条款向其他方授予的许可。如果您的权利已被终止且未得到永久恢复，则您不符合资格根据第 10 节获得同一材料的新许可。

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
获得副本无需接受。

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
你无需接受本许可证才能接收或运行该程序的副本。仅作为接收副本的对等传输的结果而发生的附属传播同样不需要接受。但是,除了本许可证之外,您没有权限传播或修改任何受覆盖的作品。如果您不接受本许可证,这些行为即属于侵犯版权。因此,通过修改或传播受覆盖的作品,即表示您接受这样做的本许可证。

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
10. 对下游接收者的自动许可。

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
每次您传达受保护的作品时,收件人都会自动从原始许可方那里获得一个许可,以运行、修改和传播该作品,并受本许可证的约束。您无需负责执行第三方对本许可证的遵守情况。

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
一个"实体交易"是一种转让组织控制权或其基本全部资产、划分组织或合并组织的交易。如果受保护作品的传播源于实体交易,则在该交易中收到作品副本的每一方还将收到前任权利人根据上一段规定所拥有或可授予的所有许可权,以及从前任权利人处获得相应源代码的权利,前提是前任权利人拥有或能够以合理的努力获得该源代码。

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
您可能不会对本许可证下授予或确认的权利施加任何进一步的限制。例如,您不得对根据本许可证授予的权利收取许可费、版税或其他费用,并且您不得提起诉讼(包括在诉讼中提起交叉诉求或反诉)声称制造、使用、销售、要约销售或进口该程序或其任何部分侵犯了任何专利权.

  11. Patents.  专利。

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
一个"贡献者"是一个版权持有人,他授权在本许可证下使用该程序或该程序所基于的作品。因此被许可的作品被称为贡献者的"贡献版本"。

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
贡献者的"必要专利权申索"是指贡献者所拥有或控制的所有专利权申索,无论是已经取得的还是今后取得的,它们将在某种方式下被本许可证允许的贡献版本的制作、使用或销售所侵犯,但不包括仅因贡献版本的进一步修改而被侵犯的申索。就本定义而言,"控制"包括以符合本许可证要求的方式授予专利分许可的权利。

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
每个贡献者授予您一项非独占的、全球性的、免版税的专利许可,涵盖该贡献者的基本专利权利主张,以制造、使用、销售、许诺销售、进口并以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献版本的内容。

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
在以下三个段落中,"专利许可"是任何称呼的明示协议或承诺,不强制执行专利(如明示允许实施专利或不起诉专利侵权的契约)。向某方"授予"此类专利许可,意味着作出此类协议或承诺,不对该方强制执行专利。

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
如果您传播受版权保护的作品，故意依赖于专利许可,而该作品的相应源代码不可供任何人免费获取和复制,通过公开可用的网络服务器或其他便捷方式,那么您必须(1)确保相应源代码可供获取,或(2)放弃对该特定作品的专利许可权益,或(3)按照本许可证的要求,将专利许可权扩展给下游接收方。"故意依赖"意味着您实际知道,如果没有专利许可,您在某个国家传播受版权保护的作品,或接收方在某个国家使用该作品,将会侵犯您有理由认为有效的一个或多个可识别的专利。

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
如果根据单个交易或安排,您传达或通过促进传达受保护的作品,并向接收受保护作品的某些当事人授予专利许可,允许他们使用、传播、修改或传达受保护作品的特定副本,那么您授予的专利许可将自动延伸到受保护作品及基于该作品的所有接收方。

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
如果专利许可证不包含在其范围内、禁止行使或以不行使本许可证下特别授予的一个或多个权利为条件,则该许可证属于"歧视性"。如果您是与从事软件分发业务的第三方达成安排的一方,并且根据您传播该作品的活动向第三方付费,且第三方向任何接受您传播的受保护作品的一方授予歧视性专利许可证(a)与您传播的受保护作品或从这些副本制作的副本相关,或(b)主要与包含受保护作品的特定产品或汇编相关,除非您在 2007 年 3 月 28 日之前就已经达成该安排或获得该专利许可证,否则您不得传播受保护作品。

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
根据适用的专利法律，此许可证中的任何内容都不应被解释为排除或限制您可能获得的任何默示许可或其他侵权抗辩。

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
12. 不能放弃他人的自由。

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
如果向您施加的条件(无论是根据法院命令、协议或其他方式)与本许可证的条件相矛盾,这并不能使您免于遵守本许可证的条件。如果您无法同时满足本许可证和其他相关义务,那么您就不能传播该作品。例如,如果您同意了一些条款,要求您从您传播该程序的对象那里收取使用费,那么唯一能满足这些条款和本许可证的方法就是完全放弃传播该程序。

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
使用 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证。

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，您有权将任何受保护的作品与根据 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证第 3 版许可的作品链接或组合成单个组合作品,并传播所产生的作品。本许可证的条款将继续适用于受保护的部分, 但 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证第 13 节关于通过网络进行交互的特殊要求将适用于该组合。

  14. Revised Versions of this License.
本许可证的修订版本。

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
自由软件基金会可能不时发布经修订和/或新版本的 GNU 通用公共许可证。这些新版本的精神将类似于当前版本,但可能会在细节上有所不同,以解决新的问题或问题。

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
每个版本都有一个独特的版本号。如果该程序指定某个编号版本的 GNU 通用公共许可证"或任何更新版本"适用于它，您可以选择遵循该编号版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何更新版本的条款和条件。如果该程序没有指定 GNU 通用公共许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会发布的任何版本。

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
如果程序指定代理可以决定可以使用哪些未来版本的 GNU 通用公共许可证,则该代理对接受该版本的公开声明永久授权您为该程序选择该版本。

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
后来的许可版本可能会给您额外或不同的权限。但是,由于您选择遵循后来的版本,任何作者或版权持有人都不会受到额外的义务。

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
免责声明。

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
对于该程序,在适用法律允许的范围内,没有任何担保。除非版权持有人和/或其他方以书面形式另有说明,否则他们提供的程序是"按原样"提供的,不附带任何明示或暗示的担保,包括但不限于适销性和特定用途适用性的暗示担保。程序的质量和性能的全部风险由您承担。如果该程序存在缺陷,您将承担所有必要的维修、修理或更正的费用。

  16. Limitation of Liability.
责任限制。

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或书面约定,任何版权持有人或者按上述许可修改并/或传播该程序的其他方,均不对您承担损害赔偿责任,包括由于使用或无法使用该程序而产生的任何一般性、特殊的、偶发的或间接的损害(包括但不限于数据损失或数据不准确,您或第三方遭受的损失,或该程序无法与任何其他程序配合使用),即使该版权持有人或其他方已被告知可能会发生此类损害。

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
第 15 条和第 16 条的解释。

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
如果上述免责声明和责任限制无法按照其条款在当地产生法律效力,审查法院应当适用最接近绝对免除与该程序有关的所有民事责任的当地法律,除非在缴费后随附该程序副本的同时,还伴有担保或责任承担。

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
条款和条件结束

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
如何将这些条款应用到您的新程序中

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
如果您开发了一个新程序,并希望它对公众发挥最大的作用,那么实现这一目标的最佳方式是将其设为自由软件,让所有人都可以在这些条款下重新分发和修改。

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
为此,请将以下声明附加到程序。最安全的方式是将它们附加到每个源文件的开头,以最有效地声明免责声明;每个文件应至少包含"版权"行和一个指向完整声明所在位置的指针。

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
这个程序的名称和简要功能介绍如下: Copyright (C)  

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
这个程序是自由软件:您可以根据由自由软件基金会发布的 GNU 通用公共许可证的条款重新分发和/或修改它,许可证的第 3 版或(您选择的)任何更高版本。

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
这个程序是在希望它会有用的前提下分发的,但是没有任何担保;甚至没有任何关于适销性或特定用途适用性的隐含担保。有关详细信息,请参阅 GNU 通用公共许可证。

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
您应该已经收到了与本程序一起提供的 GNU 通用公共许可证的副本。如果没有,请参见 .

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
也添加通过电子邮件和纸质邮件联系您的信息。

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
如果程序执行终端交互，在进入交互模式时应该输出类似这样的简短通知:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
此程序由  拥有版权 (C) 。本程序不提供任何担保;键入 `show w' 查看详细信息。这是自由软件,您可以在某些条件下重新分发它;键入 `show c' 查看详细信息。

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
假设命令 `show w` 和 `show c` 应该显示通用公共许可证的适当部分。当然，您的程序的命令可能会有所不同;对于 GUI 界面,您将使用"关于"框。

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
您还应该让您的雇主（如果您工作为程序员）或学校（如果有的话）签署"版权免责声明"，如果需要的话。关于这个以及如何应用和遵循 GNU GPL，请参见。

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

这个 GNU 通用公共许可证不允许将你的程序纳入专有程序中。如果你的程序是一个子程序库，你可以考虑允许将专有应用程序与该库链接为更为有用。如果这就是你想要做的,请使用 GNU 宽通用公共许可证(LGPL) 而不是这个许可证。但首先,请阅读。
